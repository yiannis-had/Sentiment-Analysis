# Sentiment analysis interface on Tweets using Python
Place your keys in the twitter_keys.py file

twitter_analysis.py is a separate file that performs sentiment analysis on collected tweets

twitter_streamer.py is also a separate file that collects live Tweets (except RTs) that contain a list of keywords, "brexit" in this case

Run twitter_gui.py for the GUI and real time analysis
